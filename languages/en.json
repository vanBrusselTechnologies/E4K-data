As soon as the soldiers are in line for treatment, they no longer require space in the military hospital and therefore open up room for the wounded from the next battle.

For this reason, using your player name as your password is just as unadvisable as using &quot;123456&quot; or &quot;password&quot;.\n\n- If you feel at any time that your password is not secure, you can easily change it. First tap on &quot;Settings&quot; at the top right of the screen. Then tap on &quot;Options&quot; and finally the silver key.\n\n- If you visit a questionable website or download software of suspicious origin, programs which spy on your passwords are sometimes installed onto your computer without your knowledge.

    "help_shapeshifter": "The attack of the shapeshifters is a time limited event in which you can anonymously fight and compete against other castle lords on the world map. At the start of the event, shapeshifter totems will appear in front of your castle in the Great Empire. Each totem represents a real player on the world map and will imitate that players actions. \n\nNew totems will appear outside your castle each day during the event, but you can only attack each totem once!\n\nEach attack on a shapeshifter totem will cost you one attack rune. Each castle lord is granted five free attack runes each day, while a maximum of five additional runes can be purchased daily. Additional attack runes can only be purchased once you have used all your current runes.\n\nImportant: Attack runes must be used on the same day on which they were purchased or they will be lost with the daily event reset.\n\nWhen attacking shapeshifter totems, you will only lose tools that have been used during the attack, while all your troops will return to your castle without any loss, even in defeat. Troops will be lost when attacking in hardcore mode, however, the rewards for these attacks will be greater. Beware: The shapeshifters are a cunning bunch and often hide information about themselves in battle reports. \n\nAttacking shapeshifter totems will earn you shapeshifter charms and event points depending how well you plan and execute your attacks. Once youve collected points on five different occassions, you will complete a point series. The highest point series you achieve during the event will be saved and used in the event rankings. Your ranking position will earn you shapeshifter insignias, which can be spent in the event shop. \n\nYou can increase the number of points each attack earns by purchasing point boosters from the event shop. Please note that these point boosters can only be used during certain shapeshifter events.\n\nEnemies can also launch attacks on your castle, but theres no need to worry, since you wont sustain any damage to your buildings or units. However, it is always worth keeping your defenses strong to reduce the amount of event points your enemy attackers receive. You can access a special shapeshifter view in your defense overview to help you get a better picture of your defenses against shapeshifter attacks.\n\nThe attack of the shapeshifters is a single player event, so you are unable to call upon your alliance for assistance, though you can always turn to them for advice on how to best defend your castle.",

Therefore, we decided to use the simplest technical implementations rather than spend many months of production on an event that may be poorly received. It is for this reason that all players start at level 1. \n\nIf the event is a success in terms of player enjoyment and participation, we will look into the possibility of implementing more complex features including different starting levels during future events. \n\n- Why are some servers excluded from the event?\nAgain, this decision was made due to technical limitations, specifically those that relate to displaying localized text within the new temporary server. Although it was our initial intention to make the event available to all players, we found that the user interface struggled to properly display certain languages resulting in a poor user experience. \n\n- Why do we focus on PvP?\nWe based many of the elements featured in the new event on feedback we have received from our community. As many players regularly request more PvP events in the game, we decided to place the main focus of the Outer Realms event on PvP.",

If the skill unlocks an ability, you can equip it in the generals ability menu. \n\nYou will never have enough skill points to unlock all of a generals skills, so choose wisely. If you want to use different skills, reset the skill tree to regain all spent skill points and deactivate all of the generals skills and abilities. You can then use your skill points again to activate skills. Each reset requires a skill reset token.",

Trust your gut and your surroundings more than mere words.”\n\nDuring uncertain times, even the noblest ruler requires people with special talents to accomplish tasks unsuitable for knights or warriors. When stealth and discretion are required, the noble lords of the Empire can turn to Leo and his loyal falcon Ayala.\n\nA true son of the forest, Leo is a hunter and gatherer of food and intelligence. Leo trusts his instincts more than any person. His skills dont stop there though! Leo is also a master of close range weapons, especially a dagger. Rumor even has it, that the dagger he owns was a gift from the Emperor for a successful hunt.\n\nFew details are known about Leos early life, but he has been known to tell stories over a tankard of ale, of how he earned his skills in the great cool rain forests of the western coast lands. Among the giant trees, Leo learned how to watch his prey while remaining unseen, how to stalk and track and hunt beasts big and small, and how to read the land, the sky, and the behavior of animals and humans alike. Few things escape his keen gaze, and for anything hidden from his view, his faithful feathered friend is willing to provide aerial support.\n\nLeo has wandered through all the lands of the continent, selling his skills to those in need. Yet he follows his own personal code of honor, and would never take a task that would make the weak and powerless suffer. Leo likes to keep a low profile and avoids getting too caught up in the politics of the Great Empire. Instead he focuses on honest trade, those people dear to him, and being at one with nature.",
    "generals_characters_103_narrative": "Rebel Pirate Alyssa\n\n“Don’t tell me your life story! Tell me for how much gold you’d sell your boots, and I’ll know everything there is to know about you!”\n\nThere are many words you could use to describe Alyssa. Adventurous, courageous, ruthless, greedy … but the most suitable word would be &quot;clever&quot; … maybe sometimes even too clever for her own good.\n\nA daughter of the mighty Storm Islands warriors, she was given the birth name Atami, which means &quot;clever&quot; in their native language. \nEven at a young age, it was clear the girl was born to sail the length of the seventeen seas on the ocean breeze. Reading the wind and the sky when the sun was high, and at night she knew every star.\n\nYoung Atami was cunning and always out for a profit. Trading with - and occasionally cheating - the locals, she found her calling when the first traders and adventurers from the Great Empire arrived on the Storm Islands. \nOne of those foreigners was the nefarious pirate king known as Redbeard. Sensing a fool who needed to part with his possessions, Atami signed up as a crew member and local guide for Redbeard. Under her guidance, Redbeard pirates plundered trade ships throughout the Storm Islands.  \nOf course, Atami’s supposed loyalty to Redbeard was just an elaborate ploy, and she was waiting for the right moment to rob him blind.  Exploiting his greed for precious aquamarine, she lured Redbeard and his most loyal crew to a deserted atoll. Atami and her followers quickly took control of Redbeard’s flagship, set sail, and left the raging pirate king behind. \nKnowing that Redbeard would eventually be rescued by other ships in his fleet, Atami decided to sail to friendlier waters and took on the name Alyssa. This name would soon become infamous across the seventeen seas.\nOver the following years, Alyssa and her Stormcloud pirates would sail, trade, fight and feast all over the world, from the Sunrise Realm to the rainy shores of Berimond. Her navigation skills got the crew through every storm. Her merciless blade and sharp wit saw the Stormcloud pirates beat every foe who stood against them. And Alyssa’s sense of profit brought them lots of lucrative trade deals and mercenary work. Their ships hold filled up with loot and wealth, and Alyssa’s love of treasure would become legendary at every port and island. \nYet Alyssa followed her own code of honor, showing mercy to defeated foes, never taking from the poor, and helping sailors in need who were at the mercy of the ocean. \n\nYears later, Alyssa and her crew arrived in the Tangled Wilderness. Seeking treasure in the jungle, she and her crew instead stumbled upon Leo the Wildland Hunter. While the plucky pirate and the stoic ranger made quite the contrast, they got along surprisingly well. Leo insisted that he was not lost, but merely needed a passage back to the Empire. Alyssa was happy to give her new friend a hand and to have a new victim to play dice games with. Her crew knew better than to gamble with Alyssa.\n\nBack in the Empire, Leo introduced her to some of his contacts among the nobility. Alyssa now offers her services to those who need it … for a generous compensation, of course.",

No, it’s not Victoria.”\n\nA deadly warrior raised by her parents in the arts of the dragon cult, with the goal of making Toril the next Lady of the Flames. The inhuman training and dark nature of the dragon cult scarred her body and mind, but also made her a master of the glaive, an unrivaled dragon rider, and awoke a strategic mindset and unyielding bravery within her. But most importantly, and despite all the hardship, she never lost her heart. \n\nTorils skills always ensured her victory in every battle against the enemies of the dragon cult, fighting side by side with her cousin Yigris. But the true dangers came from her fellow cultists: rivalries, murder, backstabbing. Blades in the night, quick hands wielding poison, accusations, lies, and betrayal, and worst of all ... dark, forbidden magic. \nFinally fed up with the cruelty and cutthroat nature of her home, Toril decided to gain her freedom. Planning her escape from the dragon cults lair, she decided to take her beloved cousin Yigris along. But when the day of their escape came, Yigris, in an act of ultimate betrayal, stabbed Toril in the back with a poisonous blade! Despite the terrible wound, Toril was able to fight off Yigris and made her escape from the Fire Peaks. Yigris meanwhile, having gotten rid of her greatest rival and hated cousin, soon assumed the mantle of Lady of the Flames.\n\nDespite her wounds, Toril made her way to the Great Empire, where she recovered and entered the service of the Emperor.  Due to her wounds and cousins betrayal, she is now covered from head to toe in the Empire’s royal armor.\n\nShe once fought alongside Veteran General Lord Horatio to reach a common goal, protecting the weak from being overpowered by the strong. And ever since, she has been known to have a lance of steel but a heart of gold in the Great Empire.",

Or perhaps talk about his legendary campaign against the diabolical robber king, Wolfgard the Flayer?  Or maybe let the bards sing about young Horatios earliest accomplishments, when he was a loyal companion to the great Emperor during his days as an adventurous prince? Songs of adventure and great deeds, and about how the two supposedly left a trail of broken hearts behind them in every town and village...\n\nAs always, the truth is less colorful than the tales. Horatio is a loyal vassal and personal friend of the Emperor. A bulwark of strength insurmountable for most enemies of the Empire. \nHis skill with the shield is rivaled by none, his blade swift and just, and his leadership and strategic skills are legendary. For decades, Horatio has fought in many successful battles, several of them alongside the greatest warriors and generals of the Empire, such as his brother in arms King Eric, Toril the Lone Lancer, and many more. \n\nIn later years, Horatios heart was drawn to the north of the Empire, where he now commands his own bastion. By his word and blade, the northern marches have experienced an era of peace and prosperity.\n\nHe is known across the continent not just as a talented fighter, but also for the extravagant feasts he loves to celebrate!\n\nThere are two things in life that Horatio cannot stand: a bad bard playing terrible music during one of his feasts, and Wolfgard the Flayer.",

    "generals_characters_105_narrative": "Ronin Warrior Sasaki\n \n&quot;A masterless blade\nLike a sakura in wind\nWill wander the world.”\n \nFar to the east, at the edges of the known world, lie the Sunrise Kingdoms. Few travelers from the Great Empire have made the journey to those realms, but those who return tell tall tales of an exotic land of a thousand islands. Eternally blooming cherry trees, tall towering mountains crowned by mighty castles, and a people whose very heart and soul is rooted in the philosophy of Bushido, the way of the Samurai warrior.  \n \nSasaki has been walking the path of the warrior since her earliest childhood. In the Sunrise Kingdoms, a child is presented with three items on their third birthday: a tool, a coin, and a blade. Which item the child chooses will guide its destiny. On that day, under the blooming Sakura trees, young Sasaki chose the blade without a hint of hesitation. Consequently, she was soon sent to the castle of Shôgun Takemura to begin her training as a samurai. Takemura and his warriors taught Sasaki the art of the blade and the ways of the warrior, and thus the young woman soon became a master of the Katana. Likewise, her mind was sharpened by the lessons and cunning of Takemura’s aunt, the honorable Obâ-san.\n \nMastery of weapons and warfare, martial arts, valor in battle, honor, and especially loyalty … the essence of the warrior, tenets that would sound familiar and aspirational to any knight from the Great Empire. Yet, like so often in life … under the wrong circumstances, noble ideas can be twisted into something sinister … into a tool of infamy and malice.\n \nA blade that is not drawn becomes dull. A tool forgotten in a shed will start to rust. And rules of honor and courtesy turn into shackles when they no longer have meaning. What is the purpose of a warrior when the realm knows peace, of a blade that is never drawn from its sheath? The sunrise kingdoms had known internal peace for a long time … too long a time for some Samurai. If honor could not be gained at home, the warriors of Bushido would find it abroad. This ushered in the start of the dreaded Samurai Invasions.\n \nLed by the nefarious Shogun Akechi, armies of fanatical samurai made for the lands upon the shores of the Stormy Ocean. Sasaki, who had entered Akechi’s service after completing her training, took part in many battles. She fought in the bloody conquest of the Spice Islands. Skirmished in the tangled Wilderness where she faced off against both the natives and Wildland Hunter Leo.  She even crossed blades with Alyssa, when the rebel pirate’s fleet ambushed Akechi’s invasion force in the Storm Islands.\nBut with each battle fought, with each foe slain, each stronghold plundered and burned to the ground, Sasaki’s heart grew heavier. She wondered what the purpose of all the bloodshed could possibly be. The samurai were not fighting to protect their homes and hearths. They had traveled to foreign shores to fight people who had never held any ill intention towards the Sunrise Kingdoms. With horror, Sasaki began to realize that too many of her fellow warriors had forgotten the core tenets of Bushido. Striving for martial prowess and gaining honor in battle had become motives of their own, and were no longer a noble tool used to protect the weak and defenseless. And she herself had stained her blade and her honor with the blood of the innocent.\n \nWhen Akechi launched his infamous invasion of the Great Empire, Sasaki knew she had to act and challenged the rogue Shogun to a duel of honor. Akechi’s strikes were cruel and strong as a winter storm, but speed and swordsmanship were with Sasaki, and with a single swift strike, she shattered Akechi’s blade! But before she could strike down the mad warlord, his henchmen set upon Sasaki with bows and lances, turning a duel of honor into a farce! Outnumbered but not outfought, Sasaki broke through the enemy ranks and made her escape, first from Akechi’s castle and then from the Sunrise Kingdoms!\n \nArriving in the Great Empire, Sasaki vowed that she would never dishonor her blade again, nor follow any false lord. Taking up the mantle of a Ronin, a masterless samurai, she would from now on fight to protect those wronged by her former countrymen.\nFor the time being, she will stay in the Great Empire and offer her services to the lords and ladies of the realm. The customs of the land might be strange, the food not to her liking, and Lord Horatio’s feasts too rowdy … but the battles will be glorious and just. Sasaki knows that she will finally be able to follow the true way of Bushido.",

With a booming laugh that rings across the icy tundra, he leads his Northmen in thunderous charges and lightning-quick raids. His axe, a fearsome weapon as cold and merciless as the northern winds, has cleaved many a foe in two. The villages in his territory bear the brunt of his harsh rule, reduced to destitution under his oppressive regime.\n \nHowever, not all northmen bow to Olafsson. Warriors such as Barin reject his reign, standing tall against his tyranny. Barin, considering himself the true embodiment of northman strength, refuses to bow to Olafsson and his rule. This conflict within the northmen ranks further fuels the fires of Olafssons wrath, his icy glare forever fixed on his defiant subjects.\n \nOlafssons foes are not confined to his frost-bitten realm. On the high seas, his longships clash with the pirate fleet led by the elusive Alyssa, the fierce naval battles lighting up the frosty northern seas. In the snowy wilderness, Olafsson must also contend with Leo the Hunter, a master of guile and sabotage, who has thwarted Olafssons campaigns time and again.\n \nHis greatest adversary, however, lies at the heart of the Great Empire. Veteran General Lord Horatio, the stalwart protector of the Empires northern marches, has repeatedly rebuffed Olafssons attempts to raid the Empire. Their bitter enmity is as relentless as the frost, their conflicts echoing in the winds that sweep across the icy tundra.\nYet, in the unforgiving cold of the Everwinter Glacier, Olafsson remains undeterred. His axe, as biting and cruel as the winter winds, is always ready to carve a path through friend and foe alike. After all, in the harsh north, only the strong can truly rule.",
    "generals_characters_116_summary": "Despot of the Burning Sands",
    "generals_characters_116_narrative": "&quot;Every grain of sand in this desert knows my name. Soon, you will too.&quot;\n \nIn the sun-drenched kingdom of the Burning Sands, beyond the Great Empires southern border, one man rules with an iron fist and a heart as cold as the desert night. That man is Sultan al-Killah.\n \nThis cruel and vain sultan holds the Burning Sands in a tight grip of fear. He takes what he desires without hesitation, his greed only matched by his arrogance. The jewel of his eye, his treasured emerald collection, is a glaring testament to his vanity. But for a long time, a most precious gem has eluded his collection: the fair Princess Fiorella, a maiden from the Great Empire.\n \nAs an adversary, Sultan al-Killah is not a foe to be underestimated. A skilled tactician, he thrives on cunning strategies, employing hidden traps, deceptive ambushes, and the treacherous terrain of the desert to confound and weaken his enemies. The towers and fortresses under his rule are formidable, their sturdy walls reflecting his unyielding determination. Meanwhile, his forces, ruthless desert warriors, are as unpredictable as a sandstorm, launching sudden and devastating assaults.\n \nThe sultans refusal to bow before any emperor speaks volumes about his audacious nature. He views the authority of the Emperor as nothing more than a fading mirage in his desert kingdom. The independent trading cities of the Burning Sands, under the Emperor’s protection and refusing to submit to the sultan’s reign, are a thorn in al-Killahs side, fueling his disdain and ire. Yet, his ambitions towards the free cities are constantly thwarted by a formidable adversary: Hassan the Engineer, a loyal servant of the Empire. The architect behind many of the defenses protecting the free desert cities, Hassans architectural brilliance is a constant hindrance to Sultan al-Killahs ambitions.\n \nIn the scorching heat of the Burning Sands, a daunting adversary awaits. To cross swords with him is to court death, but then again, isnt that what makes the game of power all the more thrilling? For in the desert, as the sultan himself knows too well, even the smallest grain of sand can tip the scale of fate.",

The wolf waits and watches, and then strikes without mercy.&quot;\n\nYears ago, he was just a whisper, a cautionary tale from the Great Empires turbulent past. Wolfgard the Flayer: a cruel and cunning man, a traitor who once stood among the highest-ranking generals of the Empire, only to turn his back on his duty for the sake of ruthless ambition.\n\nWolfgards eyes gleam with an unnerving, predatory intelligence. His wolf-like grin and sharp features are a chilling testament to his brutal nature. With a broadsword in one hand and a dagger in the other, he strikes with a ferocity that has earned him his fearsome moniker.\n\nIn the Empires bygone days, Wolfgard was a scourge that spread fear throughout the land. His brutalities were infamous, as was his cadre of bandits and villains. The Weasel, his loyal henchman, and others like him razed villages, spread chaos across the green lands of the Empire, and even kidnapped noble maidens. But Wolfgards ambition led to his downfall: after a defiant stand against his tyranny, his forces were scattered, and Wolfgard was exiled from the Empire he sought to bring down.\n\nBut nightmares do not die; they simply lay low between dawn and dusk… From the depths of his exile at the fringes of the Empire, Wolfgard watched and waited, plotting his return. Gathering a motley army of bandits and disloyal soldiers, the nefarious warlord prepared to unleash an onslaught that would shatter the Empire.\n\nHis return from exile sent shockwaves throughout the Empire. Wolfgards brutal assault on General Horatios fortress forced its loyal guardians into retreat. Yet, the cunning wolf would not reign victorious for long. Horatio regrouped and led the armies of the Empires mighty lords and ladies against the bandit army, forcing the wolfish traitor to retreat once more. But even in defeat, Wolfgards threats hung heavy in the air: &quot;Dont cherish your victory, Horatio! You have not seen the last of me! You and your rotten Empire will be ground down to dust!&quot;\n\nThe Empire celebrated the wolfs defeat, yet amidst the cheers and jubilation, Horatio and the lords and ladies of the realm remained wary. Wolfgards ominous threats still echoed in their ears. The Empire must remain vigilant and united against this relentless predator.\n\nFor the cunning wolf bides his time until his victim shows signs of weakness… and then pounces!",

But know this, you are merely a small creature atop a high tree, trembling as the tide sweeps away all beneath. We are that flood, and like water, no force can hold us back!”\n\nFrom the mysterious lands beyond the Fire Peaks, from plains unseen and untamed, comes the formidable figure of Ushkal. The loyal general of the Great Khan leads the nomadic hordes through the continent, their horses hooves like thunder, their determination as unyielding as the mountains themselves.\n\nThe nomads under Ushkals command are as restless as the winds that sweep across their unseen homeland. They recognize no borders, no confines of kingdoms and empires, only the endless expanse of the world that stretches before them. They are creatures of freedom and fierce independence, taking what they need and going where they please. Their paths are drawn not by the lines of maps, but by the allure of the horizon and the beckoning of the unknown.\n\nA titan among warriors, the  formidable nomad general is a sight to behold. His favored weapons, a swift scimitar and sturdy round shield, are handled with strength and grace, relentless and unstoppable like a stampeding herd. Yet, Ushkal is no mere brute. His strength is matched by a sharp strategic mind, skilled in the arts of both offense and defense. His warriors are experts of the charge and the flanking attack, striking with the ferocity of a sandstorm. The camps they establish are akin to fortresses, heavily defended and fiercely protected, a testament to Ushkals understanding of a well-rounded defense.\nFor all his martial prowess, Ushkal is also a man of honor. Diplomats are treated with respect, and guests are greeted like kings, welcomed to partake in the nomads feasts with bowls of fermented mares milk and plates of juicy yak roast. His adversaries, including Lord Horatio, have found no fault in his hospitality, nor in his honor, even amid the trials of conflict. In fact, it is said that some of the Empires finest pieces of art have been inspired by the nomads intricate craftsmanship, their creations admired and prized throughout the land. And what stone-hearted knight or lady would not be moved to tears by the tragic and epic throat-singer ballad, “Flight of the nomad princess”.\n\nBut make no mistake, behind the honor and the feasts, the nomads are warriors to their core. They traverse kingdoms as they please, taking what they want. Any opposition is met with the thundering charge of the horde, trampling all resistance under their might. The steppes are free, and so are they. And anyone attempting to curtail their freedom will feel the full fury of Ushkal, the Thunder of the Steppes.",

Akechi appears refined, his words are elegant and subtly cruel, insults and mockery carefully veiled behind the veneer of politeness. Yet, behind this façade of cultured sophistication, resides an ambitious warlord whose understanding of Bushido has been twisted by a lust for power. To Akechi, the path of the warrior is one of ceaseless battle and conquest. His distorted beliefs have spurred on brutal Samurai invasions of neighbouring realms, justified by a deluded sense of honor and duty.\n\nAkechis presence is formidable, his tall frame radiating a potent mix of strength and speed. His strikes, like his words, are swift and powerful, the calculated precision of a man who claims to be honorable. Yet, when threatened, he is known to cast aside his principles, unafraid to resort to dishonorable acts if they serve his agenda or preserve his life.\nHis rivalry with the moderate General Takemura has been long-standing, a game of strategic maneuvering and power plays for the future and soul of the Sunrise Kingdoms. Less well-known but just as fierce are his games of Hanafuda with the honorable Oba-san. Despite all strategy and cunning, Akechi has yet to best the elder matriarch in this battle of wits and will.\nYet, it is Sasaki, the Ronin Warrior, who poses the greatest affront to him. Her decision to abandon the Sunrise Kingdoms in defiance of his rule is a wound to his pride that has yet to heal. Her victory over him in combat is a scar on his honor that stings with every remembered blow. Akechi is prepared to repay Sasaki tenfold. Harakiri will be too easy a death for the honorless traitor.\nHis aggression has not gone unanswered. His clashes with Toril and Horatio of the Great Empire were fierce, and his attempts to invade the Storm Islands were thwarted by the tenacious Alyssa. Despite his setbacks, Akechi is relentless, fueled by a grudge that runs deep and a determination thats frighteningly resilient.\n\nBehind the curtain of politeness, in the silence of his bonsai garden, Akechi plots his next move. For him, the world is a stage, and he is both the actor and the director. Those who cross him best beware, for the Shoguns revenge is a play written in the ink of blood and tears. For Sasaki, his former protégé, he dreams of a fittingly tragic finale. For himself, he dreams that his name becomes a whisper of dread that lingers long after his armies have retreated.\n\n&quot;An autumn leaf falls,\nIn the silence, steel whispers,\nBetrayals cost paid.&quot;",

    "generals_characters_111_narrative": "&quot;Fair turns foul, and foul turns fair / the foolish remain unaware / Soon, our nemesis despair / our rule they shant forbear!”\n\nAmidst the nobility of the Empire, a corrupt cabal casts a long, dark shadow. This is the sinister world of the Bloodcrows, led by the Twisted Matriarch, Baba Varjúka. A distorted reflection of the Empire’s nobility, she is a perverse parody of the grandeur and honor they embody, replacing these virtues with deceit and treachery.\nBaba Varjúka may hold the appearance of a noblewoman, but the cruel glint in her eyes and the venom in her words reveal a nature far from honorable. She moves among her enemies with the grace of a highborn lady, her words dripping with veiled threats and hollow courtesies.She embodies deceit where others bear honor, treachery where others engage in noble combat. Every utterance from her lips carries the potential for betrayal, every seemingly innocent gesture a precursor to a lethal strike from the dagger hidden behind her back.\nHer followers, the Bloodcrows, are the shadows within the Empires nobility, a grim specter of its corruption and decadence. They are cunning predators lurking in the darkest forests and untamed mountains, emerging from the shadows whenever weakness is detected. They draw power from forbidden rituals and dark magic, twisting the essence of life itself to extend their influence and reach. The Bloodcrows are the bloodied talons that clutch at the Empires heart, drawing strength from its lifeforce.\nThe rumors whisper of Baba Varjúkas blood magic, providing her with a semblance of eternal youth, though her countenance betrays the terrible cost of such sorcery. In battle, she is a cunning predator, preferring to flank her enemies, lay traps, and employ deceit over face-to-face combat. Only a foolish general would underestimate the cunning crow and her fanatical followers.\nOld tales suggest that Baba Varjúka once had a hand in the upbringing of the young prince who would become the Emperor. Yet, Horatio, ever the protector even as a young squire, managed to sway the prince from her toxic influence and banished her from court. Since that day, Baba Varjúka has harbored a deep enmity for Horatio. Her animosity also extends to Leo, who has persistently hunted her followers through forests and mountains, and to Valenta, a priestess of the sun order who has led the charge against the spreading influence of the Bloodcrows.\nDespite the terror she instills, and the dark power she wields, Baba Varjúka serves as a grim reminder. She symbolizes the price of unchecked ambition and the cost of dark desires. Her twisted visage, despite her claims of eternal youth, bears the scars of her vile magic. Yet she remains, a dark specter in the Empires core, a reminder that even in the heart of civilization, the siren song of ambition can lead to darkness.",

Bathed in a pulsating purple light, a manifestation of an otherworldly threat materializes. These are the Strangers, mirror images of us, yet corrupted and disquieting. Their existence is a paradox. Leading these entities from a realm beyond the reach of our understanding is Nukhraia, the Otherworldly Marauder.\n\nNukhraia is a grotesque inversion of a general, a chilling corruption of the human form that disturbs as much as it frightens. Their presence causes the bravest of hearts to quiver, as though reality itself buckles and shivers under their cold, calculating gaze. The barbed weapon they swing, a warped echo of earthly arms, slices the air with a precision that’s bone-chillingly mechanical. Each swing is a harbinger of terror and despair. Survivors of encounters with Nukhraia whisper tales of a being as cold as the deepest winter and as merciless as the decay of time. No sound escapes from the Stranger’s General, no emotion betrays their mask-like face. Silent and impassive, they command their swarm with an unspoken will that’s as absolute as it is terrifying.\n\nCold, efficient, relentless – the Strangers under Nukhraias command know no reason or negotiation. Their attacks on the Empire are executed with ruthless precision that’s soullessly mechanical. Borders of kingdoms, pleas of diplomats – all are meaningless in their icy gaze that sees only opportunities to dominate and to spread the insidious taint of the Otherworld. Their castles, suffused with an ominous purple light, stand not as testaments to grandeur, but as harbingers of a dread that taints the land. Every tower, every wall, is a macabre echo of human architecture, radiating an unnerving blend of familiarity and alienness.\n\nYet, despite the relentless horror that the Strangers represent, hope is not extinguished. The inexorable passage of time, an unyielding force in our realm, appears to be their sole adversary. After an onslaught, the Strangers are banished back to their enigmatic dimension, their sinister castles dissipating as if they were mere illusions. But the cold certainty of their return looms like a persistent nightmare. As long as Nukhraia exists, peace is but a fleeting dream, a moments respite in a reality forever stalked by the Otherworldly Marauder. Their objectives remain an enigma, their desires unknowable. Nukhraia does not divulge their thoughts to mere mortals. And if they did… perhaps the truth might be more terrible than ignorance.",

The sigil of the lion, etched in vibrant red, speaks of his fierce courage and the royal lineage he fervently claims to uphold. Whispers among his men speak of a savage lions attack, its mark on Leopold’s face  a constant reminder of his battle-hardened past. His feline features and regal bearing mask a mind of both calculating ambition and finely controlled rage.\n\nMasterful in his approach to warfare, Leopold exercises a lions patience, preferring strategic maneuvers to brute force. Yet, when stirred to anger, he strikes with the ferocity of his houses sigil, leaving foes quivering in the wake of his wrath. The battlefield reverberates with Leopolds maxim, &quot;In the heart of a lion, patience fuels the fire. We bide our time, yet when we strike, our roar echoes and our power is felt.&quot;\n\nLeopold’s disdain for his rival, Grimbert of Ursidae, runs as deep as the history of Berimond itself. He views Grimbert as nothing more than an uncouth upstart, a blemish on the noble face of Berimond, as well as a personal annoyance. Citizens and nobles alike report having seen the rivals brawl and duel, even in the streets of the imperial capital. Yet rumors persist of the two kings occasionally being spotted together at a tavern’s most hidden table, covered in bruises yet sharing a drink like old comrades. One might wonder to what degree our rivalries inspire us … Of course, both kings proclaim these rumors as mere vile slander.\n\n Yet, Leopolds commitment to tradition and his unyielding belief in his birthright fuels his fiery resolve to preserve Berimonds past glory against Grimberts ambition for change. Leopold III stands as a beacon of the old world, a staunch defender of his kingdoms proud lineage. The Lion of Berimond waits, watches, and when the moment comes, he strikes with the full fury of his namesake.\n\nP.S.: &quot;If Grimbert put as much time and effort into ruling as he does to seeing the bottom of a beer barrel, perhaps Berimond wouldnt be in such disarray!&quot;",

The sigil of the bear, rendered in striking blue, encapsulates his indomitable strength and the daring nobility he earned through blood and valor. Grimbert, with his burly form, flaming red hair and rough features, is often mistaken as a mere brute, yet beneath this facade lies a cunning mind capable of surprising the most adept of tacticians.\n\nRenowned for his direct and relentless approach to warfare, Grimbert believes in a show of power to crush his enemys will. His thundering charge on the battlefield is likened to a bears ferocious attack, eliciting both dread and respect from allies and adversaries alike. Grimberts war doctrine resonates across the battlefields of Berimond, &quot;In the heart of a bear, strength and valor make their home. We do not wait - we act. Our roar resounds and our strength is undeniable.&quot;\n\nHis rivalry with Leopold III of House Gerbrandt is legendary. Grimbert perceives Leopold as a snobbish and over-refined aristocrat, whose claim of rulership only stems from the name of his ancestors instead of his own deeds. Berimond needs direct and decisive rulership, not flowery words and empty pomp! Tales of their clashes resonate across the realm, their bitter disputes often unfolding in the most unexpected of places - from the heart of Berimond’s battlefield to the green meadows of the Great Empire, and even to the cobbled streets of the imperial capital itself! Yet whispers also speak of rare nights where the two kings, battered and bruised, share a drink in the dim light of a secluded tavern like old comrades. One might wonder to what degree our rivalries inspire us … Of course, both kings proclaim these rumors as nothing more than vile slander.\n\n\nUnbound by the chains of tradition, Grimbert carries an unyielding belief in the potential of Berimond. He envisions a kingdom reborn in the glory of the present, discarding the shackles of the past.\n\nThe Bear of Berimond charges ahead, unyielding, and when the moment is right, he seizes victory with a might akin to his namesake.\n\nP.S.: &quot;Perhaps if Leopold spent less time grooming his mane and more on the battlefield, he might pose a real challenge!&quot;",

Not the bastions of justice, but fortresses of fear, these are the domains of the Robber Barons.\nWhether cloaked in the darkness of the woods, nestled in mountain crags, or lurking in the foggy marshes, the Robber Barons command from their ill-gotten keeps, their eyes always hungry for the wealth and lands of others.\n\nNames like Bolko, Gamareth, and Karasek have been whispered among the subjects of the Empire, each name bringing with it a chill of dread. But the name matters not, for the purpose is singular: to plunder, to seize, to dominate.\n\nMany of these opportunistic warlords flocked to Wolfgard the Flayers banner during his reign of terror, finding in him a kindred spirit of ruthless ambition. And even after Wolfgards fall, the remnants of his dark legion continue their vile deeds, now under the banner of the Robber Baron General.\n\nThe Robber Barons remain a constant, unyielding threat to the prosperity of the Great Empire. Yet, the Empires loyal subjects and brave lords and ladies stand firm. They refuse to bow to the lawless plunderers. Their courage and valor serve as a beacon of hope against the endless tide of the Robber Barons.

Mighty volcanoes dominate the horizon, their fiery hearts spewing grey ash and streams of lava. Dominating this harsh landscape are the mighty towers and fortresses of the dragon cult, guarded by the fiery beasts themselves, their dark and forbidding magic controlling these dreadful creatures of legend. Amidst these volatile lands, one woman rules with ruthless certainty: Yigris, Lady of the Flames.\nAs lean as the dagger she wields with deadly precision, Yigriss quick wit and biting mockery can sting as much as her poisons. Her razor-sharp grin is a constant reminder of her capacity for cruelty, a testament to her unwavering commitment to uphold the cults ruthless rule. She is a woman of great ambition, not content to dominate only her volcanic realm. Yigris has grander plans. She seeks to undermine the Great Empire, to rot it from within, to bring it to its knees.\nA bitter betrayal marked Yigris rise to power. She and her cousin Toril were raised to be the cults leaders. But where Toril chose to escape the cruelties of the cult, Yigris betrayed her cousin and stabbed her with a poisoned blade. While Toril escaped with her life intact, Yigris rose to rule the cult unopposed.\nA lean woman with short hair and a face as sharp as a razor blade, Yigris rules with a wicked grin and a dagger as quick as her tongue. Her barbed humor is as lethal as the poisons she expertly crafts. Unafraid to employ dark and forbidden magics, she wields her power with deadly precision, aiming to undermine the Empire and corrode its foundations.\nDespite her power and the terror she spreads, Yigris has made enemies of her own.

For young Tom, that shadow is cast by none other than the mighty Horatio, the protector of the North and a figure of renown throughout the Empire. But where others might falter under such a towering presence, Tom thrives—an eager, optimistic squire determined to forge his own destiny.\n\nFor years, Tom has been a steadfast assistant to Horatio, sharpening his swords, polishing his armor, and ensuring the veteran general is ready for every battle. Though his duties often seem mundane, Tom performs them with tireless dedication and an unwavering smile. On the battlefield, he’s not the loudest voice nor the strongest arm, but he’s always there—carrying supplies, delivering messages, and lending a hand wherever it’s needed.\n\nTom’s skills may not yet rival those of seasoned generals, but his dreams burn as brightly as the banners of the Empire. He envisions a day when he will stand shoulder to shoulder with Horatio, not as a squire but as an equal. His optimism, humility, and relentless determination inspire those around him, reminding even the most hardened warriors of the ideals they fight for.\n\nWhile his combat prowess remains a work in progress, what Tom lacks in strength, he more than makes up for with heart. His cheerful disposition and willingness to embrace even the smallest tasks make him a trusted ally. Whether cleaning mud from Horatios boots or carrying critical orders through enemy fire, Tom proves time and again that no role is too small in the grand theater of war.\n\nTom’s journey is only beginning, but those who fight alongside him know this: greatness isn’t born—it’s earned. And with each passing day, Tom inches closer to stepping out of Horatio’s shadow and carving his own name into the annals of the Empire’s history.",

The twin sister of Tom, Alice is as brilliant and inventive as her brother is determined and steadfast. Yet their paths couldn’t be more different. While Tom polishes swords and dreams of knighthood, Alice wields wrenches and blueprints, carving her own destiny as a master of innovation.\n\nAs the apprentice to the renowned engineer Hasan, Alice learned that wars are not won by strength alone, but by strategy, creativity, and a dash of ingenuity. She thrives in the world of gadgets and contraptions, crafting tools that turn the tide of battle. Where others see obstacles, Alice sees puzzles waiting to be solved. Her traps snare the most vigilant foes, and her ingenious devices inspire her allies to press forward, no matter the odds.\n\nClever, mischievous, and endlessly curious, Alice enjoys proving that brains can outwit brawn. Her playful rivalry with Tom often spills into friendly banter on the battlefield, where she delights in reminding him that a single well-placed invention can achieve what a thousand swords cannot. Yet, beneath the teasing lies an unshakable sibling bond. Despite their differences, Alice and Tom share a mutual respect, each secretly cheering the other on as they forge their unique paths.\n\nThough she lacks her brother’s physical strength, Alice’s mind is a weapon on its own. Her knack for invention and strategic thinking makes her a force to be reckoned with. From the shadows of her workshop to the chaos of the battlefield, Alice’s brilliance shines like a beacon of innovation, proving that victory belongs not just to the strong, but to the clever.",

Born into a tribe of fearless warriors, Tizi’s destiny as a leader was clear from an early age. Brave, cunning, and unyielding, she quickly rose above her peers, earning her place as the strongest of her people. Under the guidance of her father, the tribe’s ruler, she mastered the ways of combat, strategy, and leadership, preparing to defend her homeland against all threats.\n\nWhen her father passed, Tizi ascended to the throne, becoming the shield of her people. The castle lords of the Great Empire, drawn by the treasures hidden in her wild lands, often tried to invade, but time and again Tizi and her warriors drove them back. Through her strength and resolve, she transformed her realm into an unassailable bastion, feared by all who sought to conquer it.\n\nBut not all her enemies hail from the Empire. Among her fiercest rivals is the rebel pirate Alyssa, whose raids from the Storm Islands have sparked a relentless feud. Where others are cowed by Tizi’s might, Alyssa sees a challenge, and their battles have become legendary tales of wit and ferocity, echoing across kingdoms.\n\nTo her people, Tizi is more than a ruler—she is their protector and the embodiment of their unyielding will. Her warriors, trained under her fierce gaze, stand as an unbreakable shield against any who would dare trespass. While outsiders may call her barbaric, her people know her as a fair and just leader who places their prosperity above all else.\n\nUnder Tizi’s reign, her kingdom thrives. Its treasures remain untouched, its wild lands untamed. Her legacy is one of fearless leadership, relentless strength, and boundless loyalty to her people. To her foes, she is an unstoppable force of nature; to her subjects, she is the heart and soul of the wilderness they call home.",

The Great Empire’s most revered siege strategist, he has shattered more walls and outlasted more strongholds than history dares to count. A man of quiet wisdom and unshakable patience, Hasan does not rush to battle. He waits, he watches, and when the time is right, he strikes swift and decisive, like a blade cutting through silk.\n\nWhere others see an impenetrable fortress, Hasan sees a puzzle with a thousand solutions. Every battle is won long before the first arrow flies, every victory etched into the lines of his battle maps before the enemy even knows they are doomed. His mind, honed through years of tireless refinement, is a war engine in itself turning, calculating, and dismantling defenses piece by piece. To Hasan, a siege is not about brute force. It is about inevitability. The slow tightening of a noose, the pressure mounting with every passing hour, the whisper of surrender growing louder in the minds of those who thought themselves untouchable.\n\nYet, for all his tactical brilliance, Hasan is no stranger to the chaos of battle. Though he prefers the measured pace of strategy, he does not hesitate to meet his foes face-to-face when the moment demands it. His scimitar, kept polished but often untouched, is not for intimidation, it is a final lesson for those who mistake patience for weakness. He fights as he commands, with precision and purpose, cutting through enemy ranks as effortlessly as he dismantles their defenses. No barricade is unbreakable, no stronghold beyond his reach, and when he deems the moment right, there is nothing that will stand in his way.\n\nTo Alice, he was more than a teacher. He was proof that ingenuity and patience can break even the strongest of foes. Just as she crafts weapons of innovation, he crafts victories from the shadows of his tent, pipe smoke curling above the battlefield like the final omen of a fortress doomed to fall.\n\nWith a gaze as sharp as his blade and a mind sharper still, Hasan does not need to storm the gates. He simply waits. Because in the end, the walls will crumble, the enemy will falter, and as always he will win.",

I’d burn down empires to keep them safe.&quot;\n\nIn the wind-swept expanse of the Wildlands, where forests give way to jagged cliffs and open plains, the name Diana echoes like a war cry and a warning. Once an outsider to the continents endless conflicts, Diana lived free among the untamed wilds, leading her band of rugged warriors known as the Wildland Raiders. Their creed was simple: live by your own law and never let the strong prey upon the weak.\n\nBut when war came too close, when she saw entire villages razed and innocents caught in the crossfire, Diana made a choice. Though she despised crowns and courts, she allied with Emperor Eric, not out of loyalty, but out of justice. She would not sit idle while tyrants cloaked in nobility tore the land apart. From the shadowed edges of empire, she struck, her raiders moving like smoke and fire, appearing from nowhere, vanishing without a trace, and leaving chaos in their wake.\n\nHer tactics were the bane of generals and kings. Ambushes that shattered columns before a battle had even begun. Wounds that lingered, with strategic strikes against supply lines and morale that bled armies dry long before they reached the front. Yet when the call came to stand and shield the helpless, Diana never faltered. Whether fending off raiders at a border village or facing down a towering warlord, she stood unshaken. Her blade moved with the fury of one fighting not for power but for people.\n\nWith fiery red hair, a frame honed by survival, and the marks of her tribe inked into her skin, Diana is instantly recognizable and unmistakably defiant. Her presence is that of a leader who inspires loyalty not through titles but through action. The Wildland Raiders follow her not because she demands it, but because she bleeds beside them.\n\nSome call her a thief, a rebel, even a traitor to the Empire. But to those who suffer in silence, she is something else entirely, a champion of the forgotten, a shield for the voiceless, and when the moment demands it, a slayer of giants.",

Cloaked in obsidian scaled armor and bearing the smoldering greatsword Emberfang, he is the living echo of a forgotten draconic age one where flame reigned, and the weak were turned to ash.\n\nWhispers claim Kaelrith was born amidst a pyre, his cries matched only by the roar of winged beasts circling above. Whether legend or truth, the battlefield knows only one reality: his presence is cataclysm. With each step, the ground trembles. With each strike, shields melt and courage falters. His war cry rises like a dragon’s roar, and those who hear it often fall before they even see the blade.\n\nKaelrith is no mindless destroyer he is a seasoned warrior whose mastery was honed through endless practice and blood earned victory. He sizes up titans and slays giants with brutal efficiency, his every move calculated to crush morale before the first sword is drawn. Enemies who lock eyes with him speak of overwhelming dread, a weight pressing down like unseen wings from the sky above.\n\nBut beyond his strength lies something far older, far deeper. A presence. A flame. An echo of the dragons of old. When Kaelrith charges, embers spiral in his wake. His strikes call forth gales like flapping wings. Some swear they see a silhouette of something vast and scaled rising behind him in battle a phantom of the past or a hint of a truth too terrible to name.\n\nHe does not conquer for glory, nor rule for riches. Kaelrith fights to reignite the spirit of the ancient world to unleash its fire upon a realm grown cold and weak. For him, war is sacred. Fire is purity. And the dragons, whether myth or memory, are not yet finished with this world.\n\nTo his foes, he is a nightmare given form. To his warriors, he is the will of fire made manifest. And to the world?\n\nKaelrith is the storm of flame on the horizon the last breath of the dragon’s age, roaring back to life.",

In his gloved hands rests a towering Cake of Splendor, its tiers shimmering with stardust frosting and candied roses that hum with enchantment. From this divine dessert, slices are carved with precision, each one a Lucky Slice, infused with joy, fortune, and a touch of royal magic.\nBut King Ludwig’s gifts are not given lightly. He seeks merrymakers who will contribute Lucky Slices to fuel the revelry. These precious portions, baked with love and laced with luck, are the key to unlocking the Kings treasure vault.\nSome Lucky Slices already rest at his feet, glowing faintly like embers of celebration past. Yet more are needed to keep the banquet’s enchantment alive. Offer your slices, and the King will grant you the right to draw from his Royal Gift Chest; a trove brimming with rare keepsakes, gleaming heirlooms, and enchanted curiosities from across the realm.\nA regal scoreboard chronicles each guest’s generosity. Those who bring the most slices ascend through banquet ranks, earning greater honors and ever-grander rewards.

    "generals_characters_127_narrative": "The Laughing Butcher\n\n&quot;Glory doesn’t wait for kings or crowns—it rides with those bold enough to take it by force.&quot;\n\nAmong the smoldering remains of conquered outposts and broken watchtowers, tales spread of a warrior who needs no banner nor blessing, only a blood-soaked path and a battleaxe in hand. His name is Barin, the Skull-Bearer, raider of borderlands, scourge of patrols, and the merciless grin in the storm of steel.\n\nRaised among the brutal clans of the northern highlands, Barin’s childhood was a crucible of raids, ambushes, and endless blood-feuds. He learned early to strike hard, take fast, and leave only fire behind. Every raid honed his instincts, teaching him where to find gold hidden beneath floorboards, which walls crumble fastest to flame, and which soldiers break first in battle. He needed no crown, no command—just the thrill of the charge and the spoils it brought.\n\nBarin wears little armor, a choice born not of recklessness, but contempt. He moves fast, fights faster, and dares his enemies to strike before he buries his axe in their gut. His body is inked with the victories of his past, his beard thick with ash and blood, and his belt lined with grim trophies from every battle won. In the chaos of war, his will never wavers, and no matter how many foes stand in his way, his axe finds them all. Whole ranks crumble beneath his fury, and giants fall like trees before the storm.\n\nHe leads not with speeches, but with the thunder of boots behind him and the echo of warhorns in his wake. His warriors follow because they know Barin never flees, never falters, and always shares what’s taken. He is the first to charge, the last to leave, and the one who always comes back with treasure in hand and laughter in his throat.\n\nTo nobles, he is a menace. To foes, a nightmare. To his kin, a living legend.\n\nBarin, the Skull-Bearer, is the hammer of the raid, the laughter in the slaughter, and the promise that if you hear war drums in the hills, it is already too late.",

Edric, known to friend and foe alike as the Iron Tide, is no ordinary pirate. Where others lust for gold and glory, he is the rock to which his crew anchors, a bulwark of resolve against the chaos of battle.\n\nBorn to no name but the sea’s own whisper, Edric’s journey began as a lowly deckhand in a fleet of cutthroats and scavengers. But hardship tempered him like iron, and fire forged his purpose. He rose not through ambition, but through grit and steadfastness, proving again and again that when danger strikes, it is better to have a shield that will not yield than a sword that boasts.\n\nClad in sea-worn armor and wielding a heavy plank shield carved from the hull of a wrecked warship, Edric is a fortress in motion. He wades into boarding skirmishes with unshakable determination, his axe biting into foes that threaten his crew. His very presence draws allies to his side like waves drawn to the shore, rallying behind his quiet strength when hope seems lost.\n\nHe does not speak often, but when he does, his voice cuts through the storm with the certainty of a captain’s command. He watches the tides, feels the rhythm of the sea, and stands fast when others would flee. Enemies crash against him like breakers on stone, only to be repelled with crushing force.\n\nEdric does not chase fame, he does not hunger for plunder. His prize is survival, his treasure is trust. And those who sail with him know, with unspoken certainty, that so long as Edric stands, they are not alone.\n\nTo the Empire, he is a threat. To his enemies, a wall of steel and salt. But to his crew, he is everything. Edric, the Iron Tide, is the last line of defense and the quiet promise that no storm lasts forever.",

    "help_allianceRaidbossEvent": "In the Rift Raid event, your Alliance works together to defeat a powerful Boss.\nEach Boss features unique effects that change how you fight.\n\nBoss Effects\nEach Boss has several Health Stages, represented by segments on its Health Bar.\nAt each Health Stage, the Boss gains or changes special effects that alter combat behavior.\nYou can review these effects in the Boss Effects section on the left side of the UI.\n\nBoss Health and Reserves\nThe Boss’s total Health depends on its Reserve - a pool of troops used to defend the Courtyard.\nEach time your Alliance successfully defeats Courtyard troops, they are resupplied from the Reserve.\nThis reduces the Reserve count, and the Boss’s Health Bar decreases accordingly.\n\nExample:\nIf the Boss starts with Courtyard that holds 100 troops and the Reserve containing 900 more, defeating all Courtyard troops triggers the resupply from the Reserve and decrease it to 800 and lowers the Boss’s Health to 90%.\n\nWalls and Breaching\nBefore attacking the Courtyard, the Wall must be breached.\nThe Wall’s Health is also represented by defending troops, but these troops are regenerated, not resupplied from the Reserve.\n\nWhen a Wall segment is destroyed:\n- It becomes breached, allowing attacks to pass through directly into the Courtyard.\n- After a cooldown time the Wall regenerates with new troops.\n\nWall regeneration does not affect the Boss’s Health or Reserve. Because Wall troops respawn indefinitely, it’s important for your Alliance to coordinate attacks and make the most of every breach.\n\nThe current Wall status can be viewed in the Wall Status section at the bottom right of the UI.\n\nActivity Points and Rewards\nDefeating enemy troops in both the Courtyard and Walls grants Activity Points.\n- Activity Points are earned individually.\n- Activity Rewards unlock automatically once you reach each threshold.\n\nWhen your Alliance defeats the Boss on any of the 10 difficulty levels, you earn an additional Boss Defeat Reward if you meet the eligibility treshold.\n\nSummary Tips\n- Focus coordinated attacks during Wall breaches.\n- Check Boss Effects before each Health Stage.\n- Track your Activity Points for automatic rewards.\n- Work together to defeat all 10 Boss levels.",

The Sun Order, an ancient sisterhood of healers and warriors, teaches that true strength lies not in domination, but in protection. Valenta has taken this creed into her heart, and onto every battlefield she graces.\n\nClad in chainmail beneath a flowing white habit trimmed with gold, she carries the Order’s sacred sigil of the sun upon her shield. Her mace strikes not with fury, but with purpose, deliberate, precise, and unyielding. Towering in both stature and spirit, she is the rampart behind which the weak find shelter, and the wall against which enemy hordes shatter in vain.\n\nValenta’s strength is not just of the body, but of the soul. Her resolve burns as fiercely as the sun she serves. With each blow she endures, her allies find renewed courage. With each shield raised in defense, she reminds the world that mercy and might are not opposites, but allies.\n\nHer rise within the Order was not born of ambition, but of unwavering devotion. Time and again, she placed herself between danger and those who could not defend themselves. Through this, she became not just a protector, but an icon, a living bastion of hope and resilience.\n\nTo her sisters, Valenta is the embodiment of the Sun Order’s highest virtues. To her enemies, she is an immovable force, the Paladin who turns back sieges and quells the chaos of war with the calm certainty of dawn. And to those she shields, she is more than a warrior, she is a guardian, a guiding light, and the unbreakable heart of every defense.",

A soldier forged in the crucible of endless war, Garrik does not chase glory or titles. He is not a knight draped in banners, but a bulwark of quiet strength, shaped by duty and tempered by loss.\n\nBorn the son of a blacksmith, Garrik learned early the value of endurance, of metal that bends but does not break. He enlisted not for honor, but to protect those who could not raise a blade. From the trenches of the Siege of Hallowspire to the frozen fields of Frostmoor, Garrik has stood when others fled, his greatshield raised, his footing unshaken. Where commanders fell and kingdoms burned, he held the line.\n\nAfter decades of service, Garrik became more than a soldier, he became a symbol. The defenders of the Northern Reach rally behind him, bolstered by his steady presence and unwavering resolve. His armor bears the scars of a hundred battles, not as decoration, but as testament to every life he’s protected. To his allies, he is the anchor that keeps chaos at bay. To his enemies, he is the last face they see before their advance is broken.\n\nBut Garriks strength lies not only in steel, it lies in patience, in discipline, in the quiet conviction that holding the wall matters more than who gets the praise. He believes that a man’s worth is not measured in victories, but in the lives he preserves.\n\nTo the world, Garrik is the Iron Bastion, unyielding, immovable, eternal. He is not the sword that strikes, but the shield that stands. In an age of ambition and upheaval, he is the calm in the storm, the line that does not falter, the fortress that never falls.",

A hunter, a guardian, a mystery to many, she is the wild’s silent voice and fierce defender.\n\nRaised in a village nestled deep within the forest, Ashira was taught to listen rather than speak, to watch rather than strike. Her kin believed that the forest had a spirit, and Ashira, more than anyone, could hear its voice. Animals responded to her presence with unusual trust, and over time she formed bonds with creatures that others feared. The great falcon Ayala, companion to her childhood friend Leo, comes to her aid when summoned. Wolves run at her side, not as pets, but as allies, ready to strike from the undergrowth when her signal is given.\n\nArmed with a longbow and reinforced arrows, Ashira’s precision is unmatched. Where others rely on brute force, she lets patience and instinct guide her hand. Even beasts thought invincible have fallen to a single arrow from her bow. Her tactics are as fluid as the forest she calls home, striking from the shadows, vanishing into the green, and wearing down invaders with tireless ambushes. She needs no army, only the land and the creatures that dwell within it.\n\nThough her heart beats with rebellion against the cruelty of empires, she does not fight for crowns or glory. When the balance of the wild is threatened, Ashira steps forward. For those in need, she becomes a silent sentinel, emerging from the forest to shield the helpless and drive back the unnatural. Her strength is not in numbers, but in courage, intuition, and the unshakable bond she shares with the natural world.\n\nTo some, she is a ghost. To others, a myth. But to those who have seen her fight, or been spared by her mercy, she is legend. Ashira, the Wolf Whisperer, is the untamed soul of the wild, a bowstring drawn in nature’s defense, and a reminder that even the softest voice can strike with thunder when the land itself calls.",
